        <h2>Places & Bases</h2>
        <p>A simple section about <b>places and bases</b>.</p>

        <br>
        <p>The drawing here shows the Base-10 system for writing numbers. The sideways square brackets ([) are <b>buckets</b>, which are places for digits (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 0) to go. Each bucket has a <b>place value</b>.</p>
        <p>Each place value has its own amount. You can see in the diagram that each corresponds to a <b>power of ten</b>, which is the <b>base</b>. For example, the place 3 digits from the decimal corresponds to <b>10 to the power of 2</b>, which is one hundred. To find the value, <b>multiply the number in the place by its place value</b> - so if there was a three there, three times one hundred is three hundred, so that place is three hundred.</p>
